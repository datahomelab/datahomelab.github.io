# Welcome to datahomelab.io

I have always been very keen on technical knowledge, as my technical background shows: I studied Mechanical-Electrical Technician, Electrical Engineering, Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

I had excellent grades in courses like mathematical analysis, linear programming, non-linear programming and numerical analysis. I took courses in computing in mathematics, operations research, and I wrote my final project on Fourier transforms. Also, I have a Minor in Computer Science, therefore, I am current with various programming languages and techniques.

## Software knowledge

+ Office packages: Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Project, Apple Productivity Suite: Pages, Numbers, Keynote.
+ Mathematics software: Maple V, MathCad.
+ Client-Server software: Sybase SQL, Delphi Integrated Development Environment, NINOX Database, REST API.
+ Operating systems: Windows 10 and macOS, VMS, Sun Solaris, UNIX 5.0, Ubuntu Linux, Novell 4.1.

### It's never too late to learn new things...

It's always good to keep refreshing our knowledge and to keep our mind trained. The brain is like any muscle in your body: as you grow old, you need to keep working out to have a healthy body, and you need to continue expanding your mind's horizon to have a healthy brain.

With this COVID-19 Crisis, I set out to refresh my knowledge of programming and webpages design. To achieve this, I installed a development Apache2 WWW server in my home and I started creating websites. I am presently designing one for a real estate business which includes Application Programming Interface (API) connections to an online database which I've also designed. I'm planning to eventually port the application to Swift so that it runs natively on iPads and macOS machines.

Also, since last year I have been learning DEVOPS: Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, and how to develop in this new and more complex world. I have taken courses on Swift, HTML and JS. My next task: Rust.
